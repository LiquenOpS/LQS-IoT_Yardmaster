# Audio Reactive LED Controller Requirements

# Core dependencies
numpy>=1.19.0

# LED Control (choose one)
# For real Raspberry Pi:
rpi-ws281x>=4.3.0

# For emulator mode (no hardware needed):
# No additional requirements - led_emulator.py uses only standard library

# Audio input (optional - not needed for emulator demo mode)
pyaudio>=0.2.11

# Optional: For UDP audio sync
# No additional requirements needed (uses built-in socket)

# Installation guide:
# ------------------
# For development/testing (no hardware):
#   pip3 install numpy
#   (rpi-ws281x and pyaudio are optional)
#
# For Raspberry Pi (real LEDs):
#   sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
#   pip3 install numpy rpi-ws281x pyaudio
#
# Minimal install (emulator only):
#   pip3 install numpy
